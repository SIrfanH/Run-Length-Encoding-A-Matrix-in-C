# Run-Length-Encoding-A-Matrix-in-C

Inroduction to Computer Science Class 2019-2020

An algorithm which compresses a given matrix with N rows and M
columns using the Run Length Encoding compression method and then decompresses
the obtained array again into a new matrix. This algorithm also finds the
compression ratio.

Run Length Encoding :
Run-length encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of data compression in which a stream
of data is given as the input (i.e. "AAABBCCCC") and the output is a sequence of counts
of consecutive data values in a row (i.e. "3A2B4C"). This type of data compression is
lossless, meaning that when decompressed, all of the original data will be recovered
when decoded. Its simplicity in both the encoding (compression) and decoding
(decompression) is one of the most attractive features of the algorithm.
