# Run-Length-Encoding-A-Matrix-in-C

Inroduction to Computer Science Class 2019

An algorithm which compresses a given matrix with N rows and M
columns using the Run Length Encoding compression method and then decompresses
the obtained array again into a new matrix. This algorithm also finds the
compression ratio.
